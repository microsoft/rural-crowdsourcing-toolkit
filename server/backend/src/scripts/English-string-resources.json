In this task, you will help us by verifying Marathi speech data we have collected from our participatns.\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Procedure</h5>\n<p>\n● If you are seeing this, you have successfully installed the Karya app.<br/>\n● We would have given you a “16-digit Access Code”. You need to enter the code during the registration\nprocess. Each access code can be used only once. As part of the registration process, we will require you to sign-in\nwith your phone number. This information will be used to identify you on the platform when you close\nthe application and open it again. In addition, we will also collect your age range, and gender. The application\nwill also ask you to choose a profile picture. This picture will only be used for display in the application.<br/>\n● After completing the registration, the application will present you with a set of sentences with recordings (one sentence at a time). Your task is to rate the recording for accuracy, noise, and volume.\n</p>\n<br />\n\n<h5>Risks and Benefits</h5>\n<br />\n<p>\n• We recommend doing the provided work in a patient manner. This will allow you to submit more accurate reports and\nwill also make sure you don’t spend too much time on the smartphone. Spending too much time on a smartphone could be bad\nfor your eyes and may affect your social life. We recommend not working for more than 2 hours a day.<br />\n\n<h5>Personal Information</h5>\n<br />\n<p>\nDuring the project, we will collect your name, picture, and age. Your personal information will only be used to identify\nyou during the duration of the study. We will delete all personal information as soon as the study is over. We will not\nshare your personal information with anyone. However, we may use pictures from the study in presentations or posters\nwithout identifying specific individuals. We will request your permission before taking pictures and obtain your\npermission to use those pictures in our presentations or posters. Not providing consent for taking pictures will not\ndisqualify you from participating in the study.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor additional information or concerns about how Microsoft handles your personal information, please see the Microsoft\nPrivacy Statement, https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839\n</p>\n<br />\n\n<h5>Payment for Participation</h5>\n<br />\n<p>\nBased on the quality of the recording, we will pay you between INR 0.5 for every recording you rate.\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Dataset Collected from the Study</h5>\n<br/>\n<p>\nWe will use the dataset collected from this study for further research and will release\nit publicly for research purposes. This dataset will not contain any personally identifiable information. If you have\nany questions regarding how the dataset will be used, please feel free to ask us through your project coordinator or\nusing the phone number provided below.\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Contact Information</h5>\n<br/>\n<p>\nShould you have any questions concerning the project, you can contact Vivek Seshadri by phone at 9482393817. Should you\nhave any questions about your rights as a research subject, please report your concern via email to Microsoft Research\nEthics Program Feedback: MSRStudyfeedback@microsoft.com. In case you do not have access to email, you can contact your\nproject coordinator, and have her relay your concerns.\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Consent</h5>\n<br/>\n<p>\nBy clicking “I agree” below, you confirm that the study was explained to you, you had a chance to ask questions before\nbeginning the study, and all your questions were answered satisfactorily. By clicking “I agree” below, you voluntarily\nconsent to participate, and you do not give up any legal rights you have as a study participant. On behalf of Microsoft\nand Navana Tech India, we thank you for your contribution and look forward to your research session.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Do you understand and consent to these terms?</p>\n",

This data will then be used to train computers and smartphones to understand Odia and in turn build applications that can interact with Odia speakers. You will be paid for your work. In this study, you have the opportunity to earn upto rupees 1200. The speech data collected from you will be released and used for research purposes.
